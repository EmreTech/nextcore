# Nextcore examples
## Structure
Nextcore examples is split into the same modules nextcore is split into  

So examples in the `http` directory would be for stuff in the `nextcore.http` module.  

## Docs
Some of the examples have full tutorials in the docs.  
For example the [get channel example](http/get_channel) also has a [tutorial in the docs](https://nextcore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/http.html#making-requests)
