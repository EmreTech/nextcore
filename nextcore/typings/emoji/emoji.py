        }



    Attributes
    ----------
    id: :class:`Snowflake` | :data:`None`
        The emoji's ID.

        This will be :data:`None` if this is a standard emoji.
    name: :class:`str` | :data:`None`
        The emoji's name.

        .. note::
            This can be only be :data:`None` in :class:`ReactionEmoji` objects.

            This can be due to the emote being deleted.
    roles: NotRequired[list[:class:`Snowflake`]]
        A list of role IDs that can use this emoji.
    user: NotRequired[:class:`User`]
        The user that created this emoji.

        .. note::
            Not sent for standard emojis.
    require_colons: NotRequired[:class:`bool`]
        Whether this emoji must be wrapped in colons.
    managed: NotRequired[:class:`bool`]
        Whether this emoji is managed by a :class:`Integration`.
    animated: NotRequired[:class:`bool`]
        Whether this emoji is animated.

        This will count towards the animated emoji limit.
    available: NotRequired[:class:`bool`]
        Whether this emoji is available to use.

        This may be :data:`False` for when a emoji is no longer usable due to loosing a boost tier.
